\section{Individual part: Birth-and-rate humans (Tim van Wijk)}

\subsection*{Motivation}
In the standard SI-SI model, many assumptions are made that are not realistic. I will propose a modified version of the SI-SI model taking into account the birth-and-death rate of humans. This modified model will be slightly more realistic compared to the original SI-SI model.

\subsection*{Assumptions}
We will be using the same assumptions as in 1.1.1, but now we also model the birth-and-death rate for the total population. To do this we assume that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The birth rate is proportional the total population. 
 \item The death rate of infected people is proportional to the number of infected people.
 \item The death rate of susceptible people is proportional to the number of susceptible people.
 \item The total population stays constant.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{model}
To simulate the birth-and-death rate of humans in the model, we will denote the number of births per day by $$B = aN_H$$, where $a$ is a constant. We will split the number of deaths into deaths of people who are infected and people who are susceptible. Let the number of deaths of infected people on day, $t$ be $$D_I(t) = b I_H(t)$$ and of those who are susceptible on day $t$, $$D_S(t) = cS_H(t)$$, where both b and c are constants. We  get $$N_H=S_H(t) + I_H(t) + B-D_I(t) -D_S(t)$$ for the total population. This gives rise to the following system of ODE's:
\begin{equation}
S_H'(t) = B -\beta_H \frac{I_V}{N_V} S_H - D_S(t) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I_H'(t) = \beta_H \frac{I_V}{N_V} S_H - D_I(t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
S_V' = -\beta_V \frac{I_H}{N_H(t)} S_V
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I_V' = \beta_V \frac{I_H}{N_H(t)} S_V
\end{equation}
